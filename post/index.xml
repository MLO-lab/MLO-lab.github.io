Our recently developed Bayesian approach for modelling multi-view data by integrating domain expertise (MuVI) is currently only supported in Python. The goal of the project is to further develop the MuVI framework and extend its functionality into an R package. You will work closely with other team members, and participate regularly in group dicussions. The work schedule is very flexible. Note that this position may also be fully remote.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your responsibilities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Writing clean, maintainable and well-documented code.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Developing a reticulate interface to facilitate interoperability between Python and R.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Developing an R package according to the Bioconductor principles and guidelines.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Participating actively in group meetings.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Requirements:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Currently enrolled in a German university and are studying informatics, bioinformatics, mathematics, physics or related.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Experienced in R, and have a basic understanding of developing packages in R.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Basic knowledge in Python (preferred).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Proficient in written and spoken English.&lt;/li>

A major shortcoming of current methods, however, is their inability to learn sparse and interpretable hidden states. Additionally, in settings where partial knowledge on the latent structure of the data is readily available, a statistically sound integration of prior information into current methods is challenging. To address these issues, we propose spex-LVM, a factorial latent variable model with &lt;strong>s&lt;/strong>parse &lt;strong>p&lt;/strong>riors to encourage the inference of &lt;strong>ex&lt;/strong>plainable factors driven by domain-relevant information. spex-LVM utilizes existing knowledge of curated biomedical pathways to automatically assign annotated attributes to latent factors, yielding interpretable results tailored to the corresponding domain of interest. Evaluations on simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets demonstrate that our model robustly identifies relevant structure in an inherently explainable manner, distinguishes technical noise from sources of biomedical variation, and provides data-driven adaptations of existing pathway annotations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper accepted at UAI!</title><link>https://mlo-lab.github.io/post/paper-uai-yang/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 May 2021 16:59:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mlo-lab.github.io/post/paper-uai-yang/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Paper accepted!

&lt;h1 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Healthcare is, traditionally, a knowledge-driven enterprise with an enormous amount of data - both structured and unstructured. These data can impact positively on the development of data-driven health care including precision medicine and precision public health. In recent years, large scale medical/clinical datasets, such as “omics” data and radiology reports are increasingly available. We have also witnessed an increasing number of successful AI/ML applications using such datasets to address problems such as drug repurposing and preliminary screening of radiology reports. To facilitate the adoption of such AI/ML in practice, we have simultaneously witnessed an increasing adoption/innovation of using explainability methods to analyze/present AI for Health. In this deep learning era, What is the current status of AI/ML applications in healthcare? What are the standard methods of explaining such AI models for healthcare? What are the roles of causality in AI/ML practices? What are the state-of-the-art developments in causal AI in health and health care domains? What are the limitations and how are the different facets of trust and explanations (see figure 1 below) being addressed in practice? Can knowledge-backed AI lead to more robust and interpretable models? How do data scientists and physicians apply this knowledge in collaboration and via human-centered AI approaches to further the field and improve healthcare? How are regulatory requirements for transparency and trustworthiness of models and data privacy being defined and how can they be fulfilled? After witnessing so many great achievements from deep learning lately, we propose to invite world-leading experts from both data science and healthcare to discuss and debate the path forward for practical applications of AI/ML in healthcare, including demos, early work, and critiques on the current state and the path forward for explainability and trustworthiness in AI. More specifically, we plan to attract high-quality original research from emerging areas with significant implications in healthcare and invite open discussions on controversial yet crucial topics regarding healthcare transformation&lt;/p>
